## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Sentiment:** Risk appetite returned Monday as technology stocks rebounded from last week's AI-driven selloff, though gains were measured as investors await pivotal economic data. The Dow's historic 50,000+ milestone reflects resilience in blue-chip stocks, while Nasdaq's recovery suggests oversold conditions in tech may be stabilizing.

- **Global Divergence:** Asian markets rallied strongly on Japanese political stability and US-India trade optimism, while US markets showed more cautious gains
- **Dollar Weakness:** Broad greenback decline driven by JPY strength and China's Treasury reduction plans, supporting gold and commodities
- **Data-Dependent Week:** Wednesday's delayed jobs report and Friday's CPI will be critical for Fed policy expectations; markets pricing first rate cut in June

**Watch For:**
- Employment data Wednesday could trigger volatility if payroll gains disappoint or unemployment rises
- CPI Friday will test inflation progress toward Fed's 2% target; upside surprise could delay rate cut expectations
- Continued tech sector stability after recent AI-related selloff
- China's ongoing shift away from US Treasuries and potential market implications
- Fed speakers this week (Governors Waller and Miran expected to maintain dovish stance)
