This is a simple test job to verify the job creation and execution system is working correctly.

Task: Use bash to echo the word "text" and save the output to a file called test-output-2.txt in the workspace directory.

Specifically:
1. Run the bash command: echo "text"
2. Save this output to workspace/test-output-2.txt
3. Verify the file was created successfully

This is a minimal test to ensure the Docker agent can execute basic bash commands and write to files.
