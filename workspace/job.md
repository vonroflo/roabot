Create a weather application or script that fetches and displays the 7-day weather forecast for Las Vegas, NV. The solution should integrate with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar free service) to retrieve current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast. Display the information in a clear, readable format including temperature, weather conditions, and any other relevant details like humidity or wind speed. The implementation should be functional and ready to use.
