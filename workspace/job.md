Create a weather forecast tool that can fetch and display the 7-day weather forecast for Las Vegas. This should involve:

1. Research and integrate with a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar free service)
2. Create a script or function that can retrieve weather data for Las Vegas specifically
3. Format the output to show a clear 7-day forecast with key details like temperature, conditions, and any notable weather
4. Handle API errors gracefully
5. Make it easy to run and get the current forecast

The user wants to see the weather in Las Vegas over the next 7 days, so this tool should be ready to use and provide that specific information.
