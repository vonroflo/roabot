Create a simple test job that demonstrates the job system is working. The task is to:

1. Use bash to echo the text "text" to the terminal
2. Create a simple log or output file to show the job completed successfully
3. This is just a test to verify the job creation and execution pipeline works correctly

Keep it simple - just echo "text" and maybe create a small test file to demonstrate the job ran.
