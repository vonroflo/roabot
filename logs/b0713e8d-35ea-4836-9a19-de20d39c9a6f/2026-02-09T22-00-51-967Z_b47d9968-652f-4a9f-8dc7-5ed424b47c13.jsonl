Such an outcome would be the best in four months and offer some reassurance against further softening in the labor market. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.4%, near a four-year high.\n\nGet Starting Point\n\nA guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.\n\nEnter Email\n\nIn the CPI data, economists will look for more evidence that inflation is on a downward trend after previous reports were complicated by last year’s record-long government shutdown. Forecasters expect an underlying metric of inflation — which excludes food and energy costs — to rise at the slowest annual pace since early 2021.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates steady in January given signs of stabilization in the labor market and inflation that’s still elevated. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, who both dissented in favor of another rate cut, will speak in the coming week.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n“For payrolls, we estimate the BLS benchmark revision will lower the level for March 2025 by about 650K jobs — somewhat less pessimistic than the consensus. January’s jobs print may surprise on the low side, as the BLS’s modifies its ‘birth and death’ model to account for recent hiring weakness.”\n\n—Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, Alex Tanzi and Troy Durie, economists. For full analysis, click here\n\nGovernment figures on Tuesday are projected to show another month of solid retail sales in December. Despite elevated anxiety about the high cost of living and the shaky job market, household spending has been resilient — a trend that many economists expect to endure in the near term as annual tax refunds roll out.\n\nWhile household spending growth has been solid, the housing market remains bogged down by affordability constraints. National Association of Realtors data due on Thursday will probably show sales of previously owned homes declined in January.\n\n* For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US\n\nLooking north, the Bank of Canada’s summary of deliberations will offer insight into its decision to hold rates steady for a second consecutive meeting, while warning that heightened uncertainty made its next move hard to predict. Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers will speak on Thursday about how artificial intelligence is impacting the economy.\n\nElsewhere, Japan’s election, inflation data from China to Switzerland to Brazil, gross domestic product in the UK, and rate decisions from Russia to Peru may focus investors.\n\nClick here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.\n\nAsia\n\nChina sets the tone early with January credit data, including new yuan loans, aggregate financing, and money supply figures.\n\nInvestors want to see whether easier policy is translating into stronger economic momentum. Inflation readings later in the week, including producer and consumer prices due Wednesday, should help clarify whether deflationary pressures are easing or becoming more entrenched.\n\nFresh off a national election, Japan gets a big batch of data on Monday, with cash earnings and real wage data for December expected to shed light on whether income growth is fueling prices. Balance-of-payments figures are released the same day, while machinery orders later in the week will offer an update on capital spending momentum.\n\nIn Australia, attention turns to domestic demand indicators arriving Tuesday, including household spending for December and consumer confidence readings. The figures land a week after the Reserve Bank’s hawkish pivot.\n\nSouth Korea has January unemployment data on Wednesday.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the spotlight turns to growth. Malaysia releases fourth-quarter GDP on Friday, alongside current-account figures, offering insight into domestic demand.\n\nIndia publishes January inflation on Thursday, a key test for the Reserve Bank of India as it weighs the scope for easing later this year. Food prices remain a swing factor, and any upside surprise could complicate the policy outlook.\n\nIn sum, the week’s data will help determine whether Asia’s cooling inflation narrative is intact — or whether, as Australia’s experience shows, central banks risk being pushed into a more stop-start policy path as growth and prices diverge across the region.\n\n* For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\n\nFollowing the Bank of England’s close vote against a rate cut — and Governor Andrew Bailey’s apparent endorsement of bets on a 50% chance of a March move — data in the coming week will reveal the strength of the economy in the fourth quarter. Most analysts predict only a slight acceleration to growth of 0.2% from the prior three months.\n\nOfficials scheduled to speak include key voters including Bailey himself on Sunday and Catherine Mann on Monday.

The [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) note yield also fell less than 1 basis point to 3.487%.\n\nOne basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nInvestors are expecting a flurry of economic data this week, much of which was delayed due to the partial U.S. government shutdown. This includes the [nonfarm payrolls](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/january-jobs-report-government-shutdown.html) report for January, which was initially scheduled for last Friday, but which the Bureau of Labor Statistics will now release on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe report is forecast to show a gain of 55,000 jobs for the month, after a 50,000 increase in December, per economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady at 4.4%.\n\nThe January consumer price index reading, also delayed by the shutdown, is due out on Friday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that the annual inflation rate eased to 2.5%.\n\nIn addition to these reports, investors will await retail sales for December on Tuesday and weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\nThe market also was watching news out of China, where authorities urged banks to pull back from the U.S. Treasury market on concerns of concentration risk and volatility, according to a [Bloomberg News report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/china-urges-banks-to-limit-holdings-of-us-treasuries-citing-market-volatility).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62 points, or 0.1 per cent, as of 9:35 a.m.\n\nEastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent, AP reported.The softer start followed a sharp surge in Asian markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3.9 per cent to a record high after the ruling party secured a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. Investors expect the political outcome to strengthen Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s ability to push economic and market reforms.On Wall Street, markets paused after Friday’s strong rally, which marked the best session since May.\n\nHowever, concerns continue to linger over stretched valuations, with the S&P 500 still trading near its all-time high set last month.Investors are also increasingly questioning whether heavy spending by Big Tech and other companies on artificial intelligence will generate sufficient profits to justify the scale of investments.Volatility across other asset classes showed signs of easing after recent sharp swings.\n\nBitcoin slipped below $69,000 after briefly crossing $71,000 over the weekend, having dropped close to $60,000 last week, more than halfway below its record high hit in October.Gold rose 1.2 per cent to move back above $5,000 per ounce, continuing sharp price swings after roughly doubling over the past year. Silver also advanced 3 per cent, extending its volatile trading pattern.Among stocks, Kroger gained 6.1 per cent after appointing a former Walmart executive as its new chief executive officer.\n\nWorkday fell 5.9 per cent after announcing CEO Carl Eschenbach would step down, with co-founder Aneel Bhusri set to return to the role.Transocean slipped 1 per cent after announcing plans to acquire Valaris in an all-stock deal valued at $5.8 billion, while Valaris shares surged 22.3 per cent.In bond markets, US Treasury yields remained largely steady ahead of key economic data due later this week, including monthly jobs data on Wednesday and consumer inflation data on Friday.\n\nBoth reports are expected to shape expectations around the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.The Fed has paused rate cuts for now, but a weaker labour market could accelerate easing, while persistently high inflation could delay further rate reductions.The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.22 per cent.Across global markets, Asian equities rallied strongly, led by Japan. South Korea’s Kospi surged 4.1 per cent, while Hong Kong rose 1.8 per cent and Shanghai gained 1.4 per cent.

At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $5.074, up 2.16%.\n\n## XAU/USD surges as reports of reduced Chinese Treasury exposure\n\nMarkets’ mood is mixed, with the Greenback extending its losses, pushing Bullion prices higher, due to be denominated in US Dollars. Also, US Treasury bond yields, which are inversely correlated to yields, remain unchanged after pairing previous gains.\n\nPhysical buying of the non-yielding metal is another factor pushing Gold higher, as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) added Bullion to its reserves for the 15th month in January. The debasement trade continues with more central banks diversifying from Dollar reserves to other assets.\n\nFurther bullish reasons, like expectations for further rate cuts by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed), are likely to weigh on the Dollar. This week’s January Nonfarm Payrolls report and the revisions for the employment data would be crucial in setting the path for interest [rates](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates)\n\nAn upbeat jobs report could trigger a leg down in Gold prices if the markets priced in a less-dovish Fed. On the other hand, XAU/USD could accelerate its uptrend, yet traders would need to deal with Friday’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\n\n## Daily market movers: US Dollar weakness boosts Gold’s haven appeal\n\n* The US Dollar Index, which measures the buck’s performance against a basket of six peers, is down 0.76% at 96.94. Conversely, steady US Treasury yields are capping Gold’s advance. The US 10-year T-note yield is flat at 4.208%.\n* The New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations revealed that inflation expectations for one year dipped from 3.4% to 3.1% in January. For three- and five-year periods, it was unchanged at 3%.\n* The Survey revealed that expectations for credit declined relative to December, while views of the labor market improved.\n* Eyes turn to Fed officials crossing the wires. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, most likely remain dovish. Atlanta’s Fed President Raphael Bostic, who would be retiring this year, would stick to his hawkish stance as he said that inflation remains too high, closer to the 3% threshold.\n* Money markets had priced in nearly 57 basis points of easing towards the year’s end, according to [Prime Market](https://primemarket-terminal.com/?ref=9EB5474D) Terminal data.\n\n![](https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1770660501333-1770660501334.png&w=1536&q=95)\n\nSource: Prime Market Terminal\n\n## Technical outlook: Gold continues to consolidate, yet bulls are looming\n\nGold price is neutral to upward biased, with bulls remaining unable to clear the February 4 high near $5,100. However, it should be said that in the last six days, Bullion printed a higher low, an indication that prices seem to be at equilibrium and Gold to consolidate within the $4,800-$5,100 range.\n\nIf the top of the range is cleared, the next resistance would be $5,200, followed by the January 30 high at $5,451 and the record high near $5,600.

Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.\n\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\n\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversif\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770674486744}}

The bright metal takes advantage of broad weakness in the US Dollar (USD) and gains ground despite a generally optimistic market mood.\n\nThe USD decline started in Asia and resulted from the Japanese Yen (JPY) strength after the outcome of local elections. Prime Minister (PM) Sanae Takaichi called for a snap election last month, seeking increased support for her policies. The result was beyond any expectation as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured 316 out of 465 seats in the lower house, the first time a party won two-thirds of the house since the parliament was established.\n\nOther than that, financial markets had little to work with.

Last week's peak at around $5,092 stands as an immediate barrier, yet once beyond it, XAU/USD is likely to grind back toward record highs.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, readings in the 4-hour chart support the bullish case. The pair has advanced above a bullish 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which has turned higher right below a flat 100-period SMA. The 100 SMA provides support at $4,954, followed by the 20 SMA at $4,928. At the same time, technical indicators accelerated north within positive levels, in line with increased buying interest.\n\nIn the daily chart, XAU/USD managed to firm up above all bullish moving averages. The 20-day SMA accelerated north, currently standing at around $4,890. Meanwhile, the Momentum indicator has partially lost its upward strength but holds well above its midline, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator advances at around 59, favoring the upside without confirming another leg north.\n\n_(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)_\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Silver Spot Price Chart | Live Updates | BullionVault\nLink: https://www.bullionvault.com/silver-price-chart.do\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: You can then use these real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault&#x27;s live order board, selecting your silver market from Zurich, London, Toronto or Singapore.

The S&amp;P 500 technology sector, <strong>up 1.8%</strong>, was looking to extend Friday&#x27;s gains after a steep selloff last week....\nContent:\nBy Sinéad Carew and Twesha Dikshit\n\nFeb 9 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained after a shaky start on Monday, as technology stocks found their footing following last week's AI-sparked selloff, while investors waited for key economic data that could shed light on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate path.\n\nThe S&P 500 technology sector extended Friday's gains after a steep selloff last week. The S&P 500 Software Services index also clawed back some losses for a second straight day of gains after a bruising seven days of losses fueled by fears that AI could intensify competition.\n\nOne big gainer in software was Oracle after D.A. Davidson upgraded it to a \"buy\" recommendation from \"neutral.\"\n\nAlong with the upgrade, Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said another support for technology stocks came from comments CNBC attributed to Sam Altman, the CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nAltman told employees that the startup's artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT, was back to exceeding 10% monthly growth, according to CNBC's report which Reuters could not independently verify.\n\n\"You've a sharply oversold market where a little bit of good news can go a long way.\" said Lerner, adding that \"the rubber band was stretched too far for tech and software\" in last week's selloff.\n\nWhile the software index still has a long way to go to recoup all its losses from an exodus that started in late January, the broader tech sector was progressing closer to it pre-selloff levels.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 30.39 points, or 0.47%, to end at 6,964.65 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 202.99 points, or 0.88%, to 23,234.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.12 points, or 0.03%, to 50,132.79.\n\nThe Dow was lagging the other two during Monday's session although it did hit an intraday record high, after surpassing 50,000 points for the first time on Friday.\n\nThe materials index gained ground as advances in gold and silver boosted miners. However, the consumer staples sector, which had benefited during the technology selloff, was dragging on the S&P 500.\n\nThe Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index gained along with the technology sector. Traders must wait until later this month for results from AI chip leader Nvidia, with investors increasingly demanding measurable gains from capex plans. Nvidia rose during Monday's session.\n\nComing closer in the pipeline is the January nonfarm payrolls report due on Wednesday, which was delayed by a partial government shutdown, and the closely watched January Consumer Price Index on Friday.\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in the year's first interest-rate cut in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, which could be when U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, takes over.\n\nAmong individual stock movers, Hims & Hers Health tumbled sharply. Novo Nordisk sued the telehealth firm for patent infringement after the U.S. firm launched, then canceled, a $49 copy of the Danish drugmaker's weight-loss pill Wegovy following backlash from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWorkday shares slid after the human resources software provider announced co-founder Aneel Bhusri will return as its CEO.\n\nApollo Global Management rose after the asset manager reported a 13% rise in fourth-quarter profit.\n\nKyndryl shares slumped after the IT services provider delayed its quarterly filing and flagged material weakness in its financial reporting. \n\nKroger's shares rallied after the grocery giant named former Walmart executive Greg Foran as its chief executive.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew, Twesha Dikshit, Nikhil Sharma; Editing by Pooja Desai, Shilpi Majumdar and David Gregorio)\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Stock Movers: Novo Nordisk, Greggs, UniCredit - Bloomberg\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2026-02-09/stock-movers-novo-nordisk-greggs-unicredit-podcast\nAge: 12 hours ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s biggest winners and losers in the stock market.
