Update the README.md file to provide a comprehensive description of Roabot. The README should include:

1. A clear overview of what Roabot is (autonomous AI agent framework by Vonroflo)
2. Key features and capabilities
3. The two-layer architecture (Event Handler for orchestration + Docker Agent for autonomous execution)
4. Basic setup and usage instructions
5. Links to relevant documentation files

Review the existing codebase, technical documentation, and operating_system/ files to understand Roabot's full capabilities. Write the README in a professional, accessible style that helps new users quickly understand what Roabot does and how to get started.

Follow standard README conventions with clear sections like Overview, Features, Architecture, Getting Started, etc. Use proper markdown formatting throughout.
