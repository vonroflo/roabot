Update the README.md file to provide a comprehensive description of Roabot. The README should include:

1. A clear overview of what Roabot is (autonomous AI agent framework)
2. Key features and capabilities
3. The two-layer architecture (Event Handler + Docker Agent)
4. Basic setup/usage instructions
5. Links to relevant documentation

Review the existing codebase, especially the technical documentation in the repo, to understand Roabot's capabilities and structure. Write the README in a professional, clear style that would help new users understand what Roabot does and how to get started.

Make sure the README follows standard markdown formatting and includes appropriate sections like installation, usage, features, etc.
