Update README.md and repository description to rebrand from "thepopebot" to "Roabot" throughout the codebase. This includes:

1. **README.md updates:**
   - Replace all references to "thepopebot" with "Roabot"
   - Update the project title and description to reflect "Roabot - Autonomous AI Agent"
   - Update any URLs, links, or references that mention thepopebot
   - Ensure the README accurately describes Roabot as an autonomous AI agent by Vonroflo
   - Update installation, setup, and usage instructions to use "Roabot" terminology
   - Update any example configurations or code snippets

2. **Repository metadata:**
   - Update the repository description to describe Roabot as an autonomous AI agent
   - Ensure consistency with the new branding

3. **Additional considerations:**
   - Check for any other files that might reference "thepopebot" and update them
   - Maintain all existing functionality and links while updating the branding
   - Preserve the technical accuracy of all documentation
   - Keep the same structure and organization, just update the branding

The goal is a complete rebrand that presents this as "Roabot" - a professional autonomous AI agent system by Vonroflo, while maintaining all the technical documentation and functionality.
