Update the README.md file to provide a comprehensive description of Roabot. The README should include:

1. A clear introduction explaining what Roabot is (autonomous AI agent framework)
2. Key features and capabilities
3. The two-layer architecture (Event Handler + Docker Agent)
4. Basic setup/installation instructions
5. Usage examples for common tasks
6. Link to existing documentation in docs/

Use the existing codebase, SOUL.md, and technical documentation as reference materials to ensure accuracy. Make the README welcoming and informative for new users while being technically accurate.

The README should be professional, well-formatted with proper markdown, and serve as the main entry point for anyone discovering this project.
